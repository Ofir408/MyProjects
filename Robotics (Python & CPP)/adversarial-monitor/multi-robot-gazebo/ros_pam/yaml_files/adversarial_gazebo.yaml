# A yaml file for the adversarial node
#
# Describes a mapping between a robot's name (or a namespace) to a ground truth pose topic:
# node_name: topic_name
#
# The node will monitor topic_name for each line in the list and will use a threat map (coming from the grid_server or from a navigation stack's map_server)
# to check if any of the robots "stepped" on a threat from the map.
#
# When that happens and the threat was triggered (each threat map cell has a trigger probability), 
# adversarial node will report about this to a dedicated reporting topic and (unless configured not to) will shutdown node_name.
#
# If a group namespace was given instead of a robot's name, all nodes under that namespace will be shutdown, 
# so for example a line "/robot_0: /robot_0/base_pose_ground_truth" in a stage world with several robots will shutdown all nodes under the namesapce "/robot0/".
# 
# Note that some of the nodes are set to respawn, so shutting them down doesn't mean they will remain that way.
